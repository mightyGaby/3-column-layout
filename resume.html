		</div>
		<p>When Patrón initially engaged Razorfish, their goal was to create a world-class digital site for both mobile first and desktop users, increase social engagement and develop creative assets for their brands portfolio.  Working closely with Patrón leadership, our first project included optimizing their site and engaging consumers. I worked with our creative and marketing team to introduce a new product to the market (Roca Patrón) across their digital properties.</p> 
		<p>With the success of the project, the client increased our scope to include a mobile first site redesign and platform migration. Specifically, I was responsible for building and modifying the page templates and global components. Our current focus is continued site enhancements and campaign build out. A recent example of a campaign I worked on was the 2016 Margarita of the Year.</p>

		<p>Working with Hobby Lobby, Razorfish implemented Hobby Lobby’s first CMS that handled content management, product inventory management, and a shopping cart service. Built on the Hybris CMS, I worked closely with creative and other developers to build a fully responsive site that was focused on driving sales and expanding their already dominant hold on the market.</p>

		<p>The client’s goal was to increase bookings while improving the quality of customer engagement and customer love. I was responsible for working with our creative team to design and build the front-end components for the homepage main booking widget, promotions hero and drawers that drive traffic to other trip enhancements within the Adobe AEM platform. In addition, I was responsible for the page templates for the account page to allow users to quickly view and update their account information.</p>

		<p>At SXSW interactive, Razorfish sponsored a hackathon for the Citibank bicycle share program.  In preparation for the event, I was responsible for producing an idea and strategy for a native application to increase ride share for Citibank’s program. At the event, I was selected to lead a workshop with the hackathon attendees and Citibank sponsors to enhance the idea and present the results.</p>

		<p>We worked with Blackberry to deploy global marketing websites across 39 countries. The sites required customization for culture and language considerations. My responsibilities included front-end development and publishing for each of the country launches which were built on Adobes AEM platform. This site was the largest global implementation on this platform.</p>
